# Over-engineered-snake-game

For this game me and a course-mate of mine were responsible for creating the backend part of the snake game (i.e everything under the catalog servers). 
We created a MySQL database, connected it with flask to a Java client so that the other group members had an easy access point to the servers. We also deployed on a docker, so it would be
more scalable.
